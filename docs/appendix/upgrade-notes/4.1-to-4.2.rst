Stash replaced with Phpfastcache
--------------------------------

The internal caching library Stash has been replaced with `Phpfastcache <https://www.phpfastcache.com/>`_. 
Phpfastcache is better maintained, provides more cachedrivers and adds more features to the cache implementation. 
This change should cause no issues on any existing installation. 
If you have Memcache or Redis configured in your `elgg-config/settings.php` you might need to update your configuration.
